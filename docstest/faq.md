Each model has its own license. Most of the endpoints available at fal are available for commercial use. Check for the label on each model page:

- Commercial use: Commercial use is
allowed. Even when the underlying model is not open-source, if itâ€™s marked
with this badge it means that fal has the necessary rights to provide the
service for commercial use.

for research purposes only. You can use the API to generate images for
research purposes, but you cannot use them for commercial purposes.
